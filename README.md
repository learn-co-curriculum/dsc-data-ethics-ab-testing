# Data Ethics and AB Testing

When using A/B testing as a method to optimize websites, ad campaigns and more, we may tread potentially dangerous waters when it comes to ethics. First, do our tests withhold information or resources? A bad example of an A/B test lets some users get a large discount to an online store. While a team might find results they expect, that more people convert to users if they offer a discount, they may also misallocate savings to those who may not be able to otherwise afford a product. 

There are several ethical factors that come into play when running A/B tests. Often, the purpose for A/B testing is revenue or optimization driven, meaning its common to disregard user impact when building A/B tests. We should consider if users know we are running A/B tests and be transparent in cases where we are. It’s not enough to include in a platform terms and conditions that A/B tests may be applied to them. 

Some A/B tests are low impact, like the color of a button on a landing page, but others impact how users will interact with a product. By signing up and being offered a deal, some users may feel overconfident in a product as they received it for less than full price. Other

Many times, when some users find out that others may have received the same product at a lower price point, it can cause some tension with some feeling like they were gouged or punished for not being selected to receive a discount. In this scenario it’s also reare that teams are attentive to the demographic breakdowns of A/B testing groups, although its possible to systemically extend or withhold benefits to protected groups in ways that violate discrimination laws. 

The priority of data ethics are somewhat at odds with the priorities of A/B testing.
